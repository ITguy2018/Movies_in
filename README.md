# Vermont-Movies-Dashboard

A dashboard using Dash. This displays movies that had any filming locations in the State of Vermont.

Created data from google and created a csv file from that. From there I can it through another app I created which automatically add the lon and lat to the file you upload granted it has a "Address" column with real address. See the github for that project.

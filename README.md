# Vermont-Movies-Dashboard

A dashboard using Dash. This displays movies that had any filming locations in the State of Vermont.

Created data from google and created a csv file from that. From there I can it through another app I created which automatically add the lon and lat to the file you upload granted it has a "Address" column with a real address. Which I provided a link to that repo at bottom of the page.


This dashboard took a couple projects to make it come together, after the data was created I used the Folium library in Jupyter Notebooks to create the map. Using a geojson file I found online to create the county outlines for the state of Vermont. That file is in this repo:

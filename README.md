# Vermont-Movies-Dashboard

## Description
A dashboard using Dash. This displays movies that had any filming locations in the State of Vermont.


## Summary
This project was my first using the Dash library, I created the data myself then ran through another web app of mine(link at the bottom) that puts lon and lat coords on csv files automatically(need a legit address column in csv file fyi). Created the popup markers added some html and a link for each one then saved the html to import into dash project

Created the dash project and imported map html file with iframe, created the some viz's and here is a preview.

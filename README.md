# Vermont-Movies-Dashboard

## Description
This Dash-based dashboard showcases movies filmed in the State of Vermont. It serves as an interactive visualization tool for exploring various filming locations within the state.

## Summary
This project was my first experience using the Dash library. I created the dataset myself and processed it through another web app of mine (link at the bottom) to automatically add longitude and latitude coordinates to the CSV file (a valid address column is required).

I designed popup markers with custom HTML and added a link for each movie, then saved the HTML to import it into the Dash project. After importing the map HTML file with an iframe, I created some visualizations to complement the map.

Here is a preview of thedashboard:

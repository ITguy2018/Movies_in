# Vermont-Movies-Dashboard

A dashboard using Dash. This displays movies that had any filming locations in the State of Vermont.

I created the csv myself and used the geojson file for outlining Vermonts counties in the map. First created an interactive map using Folium. Saved the map in and html file then used that in an iframe placed in the dash app.
